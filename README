#DCVA for VHR optical images

Implementation of Deep Change Vector Analysis (DCVA) change detection (CD) method for very high resolution (VHR) optical images. DCVA processes
pre-change and post-change images through a pre-trained network and extracts bi-temporal deep features for subsequent processing in CD framework.
For details, please read the paper:
Saha, S., Bovolo, F. and Bruzzone, L., 2019. Unsupervised deep change vector analysis for multiple-change detection in VHR images. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 57(6), pp.3677-3693.
Please cite the paper if you find the code useful.

The main part of the algorithm is in dcva.py. Other files provide supporting functionalities. 
Input arguments are defined in options.py
Some of them are:
dataPath: a .mat file in which pre-change and post-change images are saved as 2 variables (preChangeImage and postChangeImage)
inputChannels: either 4 channel RGBNIR or 3 channel RGBIR, in that order
layersToProcess: the layers from which deep features are to extracted. Choose values from 2,5,8,10,11,23. Recommended value for 
a quasi-urban area is 2,5,8. If your analyzed scene is spatially less complex (e.g., agricultural land with less spatial variation),
more shallower layers can be used, e.g., 2,5. 
thresholding: adaptive (for complex quasi-urban areas) or otsu (for spatially less complex areas). A comparison of result with both methods
can be found in the abovementioned paper. 

To run the code, use command, python dcva.py --path <dataPath> (other arguments are optional)
Before running, download the trained model as instructed in "trainedNet" directory.

Please note the method is not an exact replication of the abovementioned paper. The original code was implemented in Matlab and is not maintained/distributed anymore.
