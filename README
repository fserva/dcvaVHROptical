Implementation of Deep Change Vector Analysis (DCVA) change detection (CD) method for very high resolution (VHR) optical images. DCVA processes
pre-change and post-change images through a pre-trained network and extracts bi-temporal deep features for subsequent processing in CD framework.
For details, please read the paper:
Saha, S., Bovolo, F. and Bruzzone, L., 2019. Unsupervised deep change vector analysis for multiple-change detection in VHR images. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 57(6), pp.3677-3693.

Please note the method is not an exact replication of the abovementioned paper. The original code was implemented in Matlab and is not maintained/distributed anymore.
